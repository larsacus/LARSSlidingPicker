Sliding Picker is a subclass of the UIPicker class.  The sliding picker was
designed to eliminate the need for a second page to grab input from a UIPicker.
The Sliding Picker adds the following new features above the standard UIPicker class:

1. Provides the UIPicker class with the ability to be called and mimic the
	look/feel of the standard keyboard.  The picker will slide onto the
	screen from the bottom just like the native iPhone keyboard.
2. Ability to be toggled with a second SlidingPicker.  When toggled with a second
	picker, the first picker will be dismissed just like the native iPhone keyboard
	while the new picker is toggled on-screen in the same manner.  This can also
	be paired with a UIView as in #3.
3. Ability to have a UIView ride on top of the sliding picker (in my case, this was
	an iAd ADBanner).

Create the Sliding Picker just like you would a normal UIPicker (create variable,
 set delegate, etc.)

By default, the picker is created off-screen (if you have a status bar).
